# JobLand
An app that helps you organize your job search by allowing users to save jobs through the JobLand chrome extension and track their progress from applying to acceptance. Users can gain points by saving more jobs, getting further along in the process on any particular job application, and adding job-related events. 


* Created a chrome extension that uses AJAX to add job listings to our database, whitelisted a single endpoint for cross-origin requests
* Set up Omniauth with Devise to log in through Google 
* Created a polymorphic table to add notes to jobs and events, a form to add events, and set up the logic to display jobs on the index page
